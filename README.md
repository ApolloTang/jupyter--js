## To Install:

Install tslab, see https://github.com/yunabe/tslab

Note: I install `yunabe/tslab` with `yarn global`. 


## To Run Jupyter notebook:

```
pipenv run jupyter lab
```





## Development with node using nodemon:

```bash
./node-dev.sh ./contents/foo.js
```

The above will run `node` on `./contents/foo.ts` and watch `contents/` folder.
